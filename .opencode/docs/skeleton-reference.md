# Skeleton UI Auxiliary Information

To assist Opencode in writing Skeleton UI related code, please refer to the following official documentation index file:

- **URL**: https://www.skeleton.dev/llms.txt

This file contains the documentation structure for both React and Svelte versions of Skeleton UI components. During development, if specific component usage needs to be consulted, Opencode can use the `webfetch` tool to retrieve the latest documentation index from this URL, or lookup specific component documentation based on the index.
